# Better Gutenberg
This project is my attempt at increasing the readability of [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/)'s HTML books. Results will be a little inconsistent across Gutenberg's catalog because of how Project Gutenberg styles its books, but if you do notice any weirdness, don't hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/emmanuelmenon/better-gutenberg/issues/new), or to [submit a pull request](https://github.com/emmanuelmenon/better-gutenberg/compare).

## Installing
You'll need some sort of userstyle extension. Options include:
- Stylus ([Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/), [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne), [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en-gb/extensions/details/stylus/)) - **recommended**
- xStyle ([Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/xstyle/), [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xstyle/hncgkmhphmncjohllpoleelnibpmccpj))

Once the extension is installed, click [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emmanuelmenon/better-gutenberg/main/better-gutenberg.user.css) to install the custom style. It supports automatic updates, so it's a click-and-forget!
